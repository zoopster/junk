So you're interested in Kubernetes? You want to "kick the tires (or tyres)?

Well...let's discuss 3 ways to get started.

There are many different tools out there to create single node Kubernetes clusters. Let's pick 3 and if you have more you want to dive into, do tell in the comments!!!

Let's start with Minikube as its rather popular with the k8s committers, touch on using Rancher Desktop which will introduce us to K3s, and finish up with MicroK8s. This should give you ample options to find what works for you.

Minikube is a quick way to stand up the latest and 6 previous minor versions of Kubernetes on Linux, Windows or macOS. Minikube can deploy in a VM, on bare metal, or as a container. Minikube supports containerd, docker, or CRI-O as a container runtime and provides some advanced features like load balancing, feature gates, network policy, and filesystem mounts.
